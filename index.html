			<h5>Preface</h5>
			<p>The life of a fresher: often filled with newfound freedom, uncertainty, a tonne of excitement and a hint of stress. However, it is one of the most exhilarating, eventful times of your life. Whether you choose to live at home or live in halls of residence, your first year at university will be a huge change from what you know . Many freshers ( the founder of UniPal once included) feel like they’ve moved back to square one. You have so many questions yet no one can seem to ( or want to) answer them: is it healthy to eat 2-minute noodles for dinner for 3 days straight? How do I put myself out there and make new friends? The list goes on.

The creator of UniPal was tired of watching countless freshers make a fool of themselves and wanted to make sure that no first year ever made the rookie mistakes she did. She yearned for a world where first-years could seek advice and actually receive useful tips and ideas in return.

UniPal is a compassionate, lively, practical community for which first-year alumni and university students alike can seek, share and learn from advice whether it be the most sensible outfit to wear on a night out, or how to balance all of your classes throughout the semester.

</p>
<h5> About </h5 >
	<p> “UniPal” will be a social media platform in the form of both a website and application, which serves as an advice hub for both first-year and above university students who have just moved out and are now living independently- from finding out your rights when signing a house lease to what your drink of choice should be on a night out, UniPal will act as the older sibling you never had, shedding honest, unfiltered advice straight from experienced university students.

The platform will have two main features; The first feature is an automated AI bot called “Rio” who’s advice will be based upon details and information frequently submitted to the website and application, as well as the creators own university experiences and advice. The second feature, also known as “ queries and confessions”  will act as a social media outlet for university students who are in first year or above, where students can post funny/ crazy experiences they have had at university, the advice they would give other students and discuss other university-related topics which they feel may be of interest to others.

In return, students can support one another through tough situations such as facing the repercussions after a bad night of drinking, not being able to balance student life in a healthy way, or even dealing with conflicts between the people you are living with. </p>

						<h5>Branding</h5>
						<p>Unipal shall implement a vibrant colour palette to stimulate the users visual sensors, furthermore creating a sense of excitement and curiousity within the user. A simple, clean and minimal typeface will be used to prevent clashing with the vibrant colour palette. This is also to ensure the user can read without discomfort or difficulty. There are two logos which will be implemented throughout the two platforms; the graphic version which excludes typeface, and the typgographic version which excludes graphics. This is to create diversity and variety within the brand., The two hands reaching out to one another represent the connections and friendhsips which will be made as a result of this application. It also represents a “helping hand” to those who are in need of advice. </p>
